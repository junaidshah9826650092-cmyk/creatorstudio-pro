description: Automated Git Publishing and Web Deployment
---

To publish your changes automatically to the web:

1. **Option 1: One-Click Script (easiest)**
   - Go to your project folder: `c:\Users\WINDOWS-10 64bit\Desktop\vv`
   - Double-click the file named `publish.bat`.
   - It will automatically run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

2. **Wait for Render Deployment**
   - Once the script finishes, wait about 2-3 minutes.
   - Render will detect the new commit and automatically start rebuilding your site.

3. **Check Status**
   - You can see the live status on your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
